# Assembly Guide

![view](../images/LogoBotScribbler_view.png)

## Introduction

The LogoBot Scribbler build is broken down into sub-assemblies that can be worked on sequentially by one person, or in parallel if there is more than one person building.

You'll also need a laptop with the right software to control the finished robot

### General Build Tips

* X if left/right, Y is forwards/backwards, Z is up.down

### Tools Required

* None so far!

## Bill of Materials

Make sure you have all of the following parts before you begin.
