Sandbox
=======

This directory is a free-for-all sandbox.  

Use it for temporary models, visualisations or for iterative part development.


**DO:** 
* Clearly name your sandbox files to everyone else knows what they're for
* Create your own sub-directory if you end producing a lot of sandbox files


**DO NOT:** 
* Include files from the sandbox in the main configuration files!
