# LogoBot Assembly Guide

![LogoBot](images/LogoBot.png)


## Introduction

The LogoBot build is broken down into sub-assemblies that can be worked on sequentially by one person, or in parallel if there is more than one person building.

All the diagrams can be viewed in OpenSCAD allowing real time zooming, rotating and panning to get the best view.


### General Build Tips

* X if left/right, Y is backwards/forwards, Z is up.down


### Tools Required

* Screwdriver ?



## Bill of Materials

Make sure you have all of the following parts before you begin.  The tables show the number of vitamins/parts required for each sub-assembly, as well as the total.
